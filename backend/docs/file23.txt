We write the Bernoulli distribution as:
\[
\begin{aligned}
p(y ; \phi) & =\phi^{y}(1-\phi)^{1-y} \\
& =\exp (y \log \phi+(1-y) \log (1-\phi)) \\
& =\exp \left(\left(\log \left(\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\right)\right) y+\log (1-\phi)\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, the natural parameter is given by $\eta=\log (\phi /(1-\phi))$. Interestingly, if we invert this definition for $\eta$ by solving for $\phi$ in terms of $\eta$, we obtain $\phi=$ $1 /\left(1+e^{-\eta}\right)$. This is the familiar sigmoid function! This will come up again when we derive logistic regression as a GLM. To complete the formulation of the Bernoulli distribution as an exponential family distribution, we also have
\[
\begin{aligned}
T(y) & =y \\
a(\eta) & =-\log (1-\phi) \\
& =\log \left(1+e^{\eta}\right) \\
b(y) & =1
\end{aligned}
\]

This shows that the Bernoulli distribution can be written in the form of Equation (6), using an appropriate choice of $T, a$ and $b$.

Let's now move on to consider the Gaussian distribution. Recall that, when deriving linear regression, the value of $\sigma^{2}$ had no effect on our final choice of $\theta$ and $h_{\theta}(x)$. Thus, we can choose an arbitrary value for $\sigma^{2}$ without changing anything. To simplify the derivation below, let's set $\sigma^{2}=1 .^{6} \mathrm{We}$ then have:
\[
\begin{aligned}
p(y ; \mu) & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2}(y-\mu)^{2}\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} y^{2}\right) \cdot \exp \left(\mu y-\frac{1}{2} \mu^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
${ }^{6}$ If we leave $\sigma^{2}$ as a variable, the Gaussian distribution can also be shown to be in the exponential family, where $\eta \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is now a 2 -dimension vector that depends on both $\mu$ and $\sigma$. For the purposes of GLMs, however, the $\sigma^{2}$ parameter can also be treated by considering a more general definition of the exponential family: $p(y ; \eta, \tau)=b(a, \tau) \exp \left(\left(\eta^{T} T(y)-\right.\right.$ $a(\eta)) / c(\tau))$. Here, $\tau$ is called the dispersion parameter, and for the Gaussian, $c(\tau)=\sigma^{2}$; but given our simplification above, we won't need the more general definition for the examples we will consider here.
