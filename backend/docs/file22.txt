Part III
Generalized Linear Models ${ }^{5}$

So far, we've seen a regression example, and a classification example. In the regression example, we had $y \mid x ; \theta \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \sigma^{2}\right)$, and in the classification one, $y \mid x ; \theta \sim \operatorname{Bernoulli}(\phi)$, for some appropriate definitions of $\mu$ and $\phi$ as functions of $x$ and $\theta$. In this section, we will show that both of these methods are special cases of a broader family of models, called Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). We will also show how other models in the GLM family can be derived and applied to other classification and regression problems.
8 The exponential family
To work our way up to GLMs, we will begin by defining exponential family distributions. We say that a class of distributions is in the exponential family if it can be written in the form
\[
p(y ; \eta)=b(y) \exp \left(\eta^{T} T(y)-a(\eta)\right)
\]

Here, $\eta$ is called the natural parameter (also called the canonical parameter) of the distribution; $T(y)$ is the sufficient statistic (for the distributions we consider, it will often be the case that $T(y)=y$ ); and $a(\eta)$ is the log partition function. The quantity $e^{-a(\eta)}$ essentially plays the role of a normalization constant, that makes sure the distribution $p(y ; \eta)$ sums/integrates over $y$ to 1 .

A fixed choice of $T, a$ and $b$ defines a family (or set) of distributions that is parameterized by $\eta$; as we vary $\eta$, we then get different distributions within this family.

We now show that the Bernoulli and the Gaussian distributions are examples of exponential family distributions. The Bernoulli distribution with mean $\phi$, written Bernoulli $(\phi)$, specifies a distribution over $y \in\{0,1\}$, so that $p(y=1 ; \phi)=\phi ; p(y=0 ; \phi)=1-\phi$. As we vary $\phi$, we obtain Bernoulli distributions with different means. We now show that this class of Bernoulli distributions, ones obtained by varying $\phi$, is in the exponential family; i.e., that there is a choice of $T, a$ and $b$ so that Equation (6) becomes exactly the class of Bernoulli distributions.
