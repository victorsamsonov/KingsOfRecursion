Supervised learning
Let's start by talking about a few examples of supervised learning problems. Suppose we have a dataset giving the living areas and prices of 47 houses from Portland, Oregon:
\begin{tabular}{c|c} 
Living area $\left(\right.$ feet $\left.^{2}\right)$ & Price $(1000 \$$ s $)$ \\
\hline 2104 & 400 \\
1600 & 330 \\
2400 & 369 \\
1416 & 232 \\
3000 & 540 \\
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$
\end{tabular}

We can plot this data:

Given data like this, how can we learn to predict the prices of other houses in Portland, as a function of the size of their living areas?
